- [x] Make a wrapper for sqlite
	- [x] Initialize variables
	- [x] Check if DB present
	- [] Read data to structures (CANCELED)
		-[] What if write data to string and parse it, depending on last table?
- [] Make logging
- [] Make ImGui wrapper
- [x] Add constants
	- [x] Add table names
	- [x] Add column count to each table (maybe do this in map?)

- [x] Figure out the way to get column names(and count) when table is empty
	- [-] Can do hardcode with constants but that's cringe
	- [x] I can use "PRAGMA table_info( your_table_name );" but need to figure out how to parse it
